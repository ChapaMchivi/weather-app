# 🌦️ Weather App

A responsive web application that fetches live weather data from the [WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/) and displays a **14‑day forecast** with dynamic visuals.  
Built as part of the **Coursera Project Network: Build a Website using an API with HTML, JavaScript, and JSON** course.

---

## 📖 Project Overview
The **Weather App** allows users to:
- Search for any city worldwide.
- View a **14‑day forecast** with daily cards showing temperature, humidity, wind, and conditions.
- Experience a **dynamic background** that changes based on weather conditions (sunny, rainy, cloudy, snowy).
- Enjoy a **responsive, animated UI** with fade‑in transitions and hover effects.

This project demonstrates how to consume a REST API, parse JSON, and update the DOM dynamically with JavaScript.

---

## 🧑‍💻 Skills Demonstrated
- **API Integration**: Consuming REST APIs with `fetch()`.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: DOM manipulation, async/await, error handling.
- **Frontend Development**: HTML5, CSS3, responsive design.
- **UI/UX Enhancements**: Animations, hover effects, dynamic theming.
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub for project management.
- **Security Practices**: Using `.gitignore` and `config.example.js` to protect API keys.

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- **Languages**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **API**: [WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/)  
- **Editor**: VS Code with Live Server  
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub  
- **Icons**: [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)

## 📜 Summary
This project showcases a **real‑world workflow**: integrating a third‑party API, handling JSON data, and presenting it in a polished, user‑friendly interface. It’s designed to be **portfolio‑ready**, demonstrating both technical and design skills.

---

## 💡 Solution
- **Problem**: Display live weather data in a clean, interactive way.  
- **Solution**: Build a web app that fetches data from WeatherAPI, processes JSON, and renders it dynamically with styled forecast cards and responsive design.

---

## 🧭 Approach
1. **Setup**: Created project structure (`index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`, `config.js`).  
2. **API Integration**: Used `fetch()` with async/await to call WeatherAPI.  
3. **Data Handling**: Parsed JSON and extracted relevant fields (temperature, humidity, wind, condition).  
4. **UI Design**: Built forecast cards with CSS grid/flexbox, added animations and hover effects.  
5. **Dynamic Background**: Changed gradient colors based on weather conditions.  
6. **Security**: Stored API key in `config.js` (ignored by Git) and provided `config.example.js` for setup.
